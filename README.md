# Generating-Emojis-using-RNN-with-LSTM<br>
This Repository consists of Python Code in Jupyter Notebook to Generate appropriate Emojis for an English Sentence.<br>
With the increased use of modern messaging applications like Whatsapp etc, emojis have become an important part of our daily conversations. Many a times, emojis help us to convey a message with ease.<br>
This project helps in predicting appropriate emojis for an English Sentence.<br>
To implement this, we use Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).<br>
There are 2 parts in the jupyter notebook:<br>
1) Predicting Emoji using a Simple Neural Network.<br>
2) Predicting Emoji using RNN with LSTM to also consider long range dependencies in the sentences.<br>

Also, this project uses word embeddings from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

This repositories consists of 3 files:
1) Emojification.ipynb
2) Training_set.csv
3) Test_set.csv
